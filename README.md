# chromeos-file-manager-plus
Chrome extension to improve ChromeOS File Manager first letter navigation.

> WARNING!
> This extension require access to `chrome://file-manager` URL.

## Setup
Enable the following flag:
```
Extensions on chrome:// URLs
chrome://flags/#extensions-on-chrome-urls
```

## Installation
1. Download and extract this repository.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Load unpacked, pick the extension folder.

## Important Notes
Now that the "bad" flag is enabled, you need to be cautious when installing any unofficial extensions. I certainly hope the ChromeOS team prioritizes this issue in an upcoming update, as the file browsing experience has been crippled for years, and we shouldn't have to rely on extensions like these to resolve it.
